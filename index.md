# Introduction to Machine Learning
University of Toronto, Fall 2024
{: .fs-6 }
### Instructors:
Erfan Meskar

### Time:
TBA

### Location:
TBA

### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the basic theory, the fundamental algorithms, and the computational toolboxes of machine learning. The focus is on a balanced treatment of the practical and theoretical approaches, along with hands on experience with relevant software packages, namely
- **Supervised learning methods:** linear models for classification and regression, neural networks, and support vector machines. 
- **Unsupervised learning methods:** principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. 
- **Theoretical topics:** bounds on the generalization error, bias-variance tradeoffs and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. Techniques to control overfitting, including regularization and validation, will be covered.
